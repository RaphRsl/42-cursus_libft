## Description

The **libft** project is a foundational exercise aimed at creating a personal C library. This library implements several common functions from the C standard library and enhances them with additional functionalities, which can be reused in future projects. 

## Overview of the Project

- **What the Project Is:**
  Libft is an exercise focused on building a library in C that includes implementations of standard library functions as well as custom utilities to facilitate programming tasks.
- **Main Technical Features or Functionalities:** 
  - Implementation of standard library functions such as `malloc`, `free`, `strlen`, `strcpy`, and others.
  - Development of additional utility functions for string manipulation, memory management, and data structure handling.
  - Creating a Makefile for seamless compilation and management of the library.
  - Ensuring proper memory management and error handling in all implemented functions.
- **Languages**:
	- C
	- Makefile
- **Tools and technical notions Involved:**
	Standard C library functions / Memory management / String manipulation / Error handling / Data structures (linked lists, arrays) / Makefile for project automation

## Key Features

- Full implementation of a personal C library containing over 30 functions.
- Functions for memory allocation and manipulation (e.g., `malloc`, `free`, `calloc`).
- String manipulation functions (e.g., `strlen`, `strdup`, `strjoin`).
- Custom utility functions for handling linked lists and other data structures.
- A robust Makefile for compilation and linking.

## Key Parts from an Academic View

#### Subject summary

##### Requirements
- Must implement a set of functions from the C standard library and additional custom functions.
- All files must be organized in a clear and logical directory structure.
- A Makefile must be provided at the root of the repository, enabling users to compile the library easily.
- The library must be named `libft.a` and must be created in the `srcs` directory.

##### Mandatory part
- Implement a variety of functions including but not limited to:
  - Memory management functions: `malloc`, `free`, `calloc`
  - String manipulation functions: `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcat`
  - Additional utility functions for lists, arrays, etc.
- Ensure that each function adheres to the specifications of the original standard library functions.
- Include thorough documentation and comments within the code to explain functionality and usage.

##### FORBIDDEN
- Using any third-party libraries or pre-existing code that could replicate the functions required in this project.
- Using C++ or any other programming languages; the implementation must solely be in C.
- Any code that is not self-contained or does not follow the required structure will not be accepted.
