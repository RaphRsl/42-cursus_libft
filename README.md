## Description

The **libft** project is a foundational exercise aimed at creating a personal C library. This library implements several common functions from the C standard library and enhances them with additional functionalities, which can be reused in future projects.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7ce4baf-001b-41be-9cbe-b3b97b2fb413" height="30"> The Libft project holds a central place in the √âcole 42 curriculum, serving as the foundational exercise that sets the stage for all subsequent programming projects. It is the first major assignment, emphasizing the importance of understanding and implementing core C functions from scratch, as we at √âcole 42 are forbidden from using most standard library functions. This necessity to rewrite these functions fosters a deep comprehension of programming principles, including proper memory management, string and address manipulation, and data structures like linked lists. Mastering these concepts is essential, not only for successfully completing future projects but also for developing the skills needed to become proficient, independent programmers. By engaging with Libft, we build a robust library that we can reference, utilize, adapt and enhance throughout our entire curriculum, reinforcing the idea that a strong foundation in C programming is crucial for success in the more complex challenges that lie ahead. It may not be the most enjoyable project, but it is truly essential for sure!

## Overview of the Project

- **What the Project Is:**
  Libft is an exercise focused on building a library in C that includes implementations of standard library functions as well as custom utilities to facilitate programming tasks.
- **Main Technical Features or Functionalities:** 
  - Implementation of standard library functions such as `malloc`, `free`, `strlen`, `strcpy`, and others.
  - Development of additional utility functions for string manipulation, memory management, and data structure handling.
  - Creating a Makefile for seamless compilation and management of the library.
  - Ensuring proper memory management and error handling in all implemented functions.
- **Languages**:
	- C
	- Makefile
- **Tools and technical notions Involved:**
	Standard C library functions / Memory management / String manipulation / Error handling / Data structures (linked lists, arrays) / Makefile for project automation

## Key Features

- Full implementation of a personal C library containing over 30 functions.
- Functions for memory allocation and manipulation (e.g., `malloc`, `free`, `calloc`).
- String manipulation functions (e.g., `strlen`, `strdup`, `strjoin`).
- Custom utility functions for handling linked lists and other data structures.
- A robust Makefile for compilation and linking.

## Key Parts from an Academic View

#### Subject summary

##### Requirements
- Must implement a set of functions from the C standard library and additional custom functions.
- All files must be organized in a clear and logical directory structure.
- A Makefile must be provided at the root of the repository, enabling users to compile the library easily.
- The library must be named `libft.a` and must be created in the `srcs` directory.

##### Mandatory part
- Implement a variety of functions including but not limited to:
  - Memory management functions: `malloc`, `free`, `calloc`
  - String manipulation functions: `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcat`
  - Additional utility functions for lists, arrays, etc.
- Ensure that each function adheres to the specifications of the original standard library functions.
- Include thorough documentation and comments within the code to explain functionality and usage.

##### FORBIDDEN
- Using any third-party libraries or pre-existing code that could replicate the functions required in this project.
- Using C++ or any other programming languages; the implementation must solely be in C.
- Any code that is not self-contained or does not follow the required structure will not be accepted.
